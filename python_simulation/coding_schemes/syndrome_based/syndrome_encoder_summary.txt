PEECC - Syndrome-Based Encoder with Matrix Generation and LUT System
====================================================================

DATE: Current session
STATUS: Implemented complete syndrome-based coding system with automated matrix generation and LUT creation

OVERVIEW:
---------
This module implements a syndrome-based encoder for a 6×45 parity check matrix H = [H_U | H_V].
The system features automated matrix generation using greedy algorithms, coset leaders for optimal 
encoding with O(1) lookup complexity, and supports both minimum-weight and minimum-transitions encoding.

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
------------------------
- Parity check matrix: H = [H_U | H_V] where H_U is 6×32, H_V is 6×13
- Information vector: u (32 bits)
- Redundancy vector: v (13 bits)
- Syndrome: s = H_U @ u^T (6 bits)
- Codeword constraint: H_U @ u^T + H_V @ v^T = 0
- Column-Space Relation: Every column of H_U lies in the span of H_V columns
- Multiplicity: Each syndrome corresponds to 128 valid redundancy vectors (2^7)

H MATRIX STRUCTURE:
-------------------
- H_V: Generated 6×13 binary matrix with structure [I_6 | H_extra] where I_6 is 6×6 identity
- H_extra: 7 additional vectors (6×7) chosen via greedy algorithm
- Property: Every 6-vector expressible as sum of at most 2 vectors from H_V
- H_U: 6×32 binary matrix generated as linear combinations of H_V columns in GF(2)
- All columns in H_U are unique, non-zero, and distinct from H_V columns
- Matrix satisfies theoretical requirements for syndrome-based encoding

COSET-LEADER APPROACH:
---------------------
- Precomputed lookup table with exactly 64 entries (one per syndrome)
- Each syndrome maps to its coset leader: minimum-weight v s.t. H_V @ v^T = s
- Deterministic selection with lexicographic tie-breaking
- Memory efficient: ~64 entries vs. previous large candidate lists

ENCODING MODES:
---------------
1. Minimum-weight (stateless):
   - Compute s = H_U @ u^T
   - Return v = coset_leader(s)
   - Optimizes absolute weight of redundancy bits

2. Minimum-transitions (stateful):
   - Compute s_curr = H_U @ u^T
   - Compute delta_s = prev_syndrome XOR s_curr
   - Lookup delta_v = coset_leader(delta_s)
   - Set v_curr = prev_v XOR delta_v
   - Optimizes transition cost between consecutive codewords

Using Generated Files:
```python
# Option 1: Use original hard-coded matrices
from coding_schemes.syndrome_based.H_matrix import return_H_V, return_H_U

# Option 2: Use generated matrices (drop-in replacement)
from coding_schemes.syndrome_based.matrix_generation.output.generated_H_matrix import return_H_V, return_H_U
from coding_schemes.syndrome_based.matrix_generation.output.generated_syndrome_lut import get_leader

# Use with encoder
from coding_schemes.syndrome_based.syndrome_based_encoder import SyndromeBasedEncoder
encoder = SyndromeBasedEncoder()  # Automatically generates LUT if needed
```
